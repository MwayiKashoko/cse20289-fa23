# Readings - Week 8

**Assigned**: Saturday, October 7th, 2023

In lecture on Friday, we began talking about map, reduce, and briefly about filter.  This next week, we will continue with functional programming and the various abstractions that allow us to construct powerful parallel programming analyses.
