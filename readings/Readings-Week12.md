# Readings - Week 12

**Assigned**: Sunday, November 12th, 2023

With our overview of pointers, structs, and unions complete, we will do a bit more coverage on data structures next week and then transition into files, directories, I/O, and networking before Thanksgiving break.

As you may notice as well, we will be starting to draw on the open textbook for Operating Systems now for some of the material.
