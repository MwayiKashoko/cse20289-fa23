# Readings - Week 7

**Assigned**: Saturday, September 30th, 2023

We will continue to explore using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for data processing. In particular, we will review [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) and learn how to utilize them in Python and then examine ways of processing structured information such as [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) and [JSON](https://www.json.org/) files.
