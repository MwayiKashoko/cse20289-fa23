# Readings - Week 6

**Assigned**: Saturday, September 23rd, 2023

We will transition from shell scripting and filters to creating more sophisticated scripts using the Python programming language. Using a more advanced scripting language such as Python will allow us to use sequence data structures such as lists and mapping data structures such as dictionaries, and thus perform more sophisticated data manipulation efficiently and effectively.
